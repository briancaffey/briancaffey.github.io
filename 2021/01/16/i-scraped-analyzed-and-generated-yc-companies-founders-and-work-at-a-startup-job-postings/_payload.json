Burrow is a daily driver app for mobile that works on any device. With Burrow, your driver is on your phone to show your friends where you are going, which destinations you are on, and more. You can also add your phone to a list and get in-depth insights into the driving itself. We love to tie in-stream data, visualised by React Native, to the driving experience. We also take a data-driven approach to managing our customer list, managing our teams and our operations framework. Our API serves a large amount of native API functions, and using Cockroach to access these functions through microservices allowed us to interface with the relevant services (e.g. DynamoDB, Picnic and our own API). We also inserted a lot of debugging and monitoring functionality into the ecosystem. Our API serves a large amount of data - including relational and non-relational data - about where you are and what you've wanted to do the longest, what you've got, and where you are now. We also manage a lot of the operations of the platform and provide some of the data integrations with your existing relational and non-relational data.
