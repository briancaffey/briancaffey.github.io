Our primary technologies today are:Tables, Entry Points into Global Food Production, Pipeline and Grain Market, and GenomicData.utility.Upstream is revolutionizing how U.S. agriculture is produced and sold. We are serving the agronomists, farmers, market researchers, and data scientists in the USA. WWrendy is on a mission to enable breakthrough scientific research in agricultural technology. We are growing cassava in our bioreactors, improving crop health and producing more durables than we need to feed ourselves. We use machine learning to identify cancer-causing microbes in seeds and in consumer durables to make food more accessible and more sustainable. We are building an entirely new technical infrastructure for agricultural diagnostics: tractors, biores, and tractors-all with a singular goal of improving yields and feed the world. We have humble beginnings as a grocery delivery service and have since grown to serve millions of people every year. We are a tight-knit team of MIT-trained researchers, technologists, and businesspeople, who have built an industry-leading technology platform that uses sensors and software to analyze crop production data to create intelligent and efficient food products. Our mission is to help all farmers have a more sustainable crop, by using microbial discoveries to improve the health and prosperity of their communities. We're a well-funded, well-funded, yuletide startup. We're looking to grow and affordably upgrade our tech stack every year. We use less expensive tools and techniques to analyze and build comprehensive datasets on crop production and food safety to help farmers grow more food and avoid over-production.
