This article describes how I write and share technical articles on my personal website and other websites. 

I'll focus on two topics:

- How I use Nuxt.js to build my personal website
- How I share my articles on other development article aggregators 

## My personal webiste: briancaffey.github.io

I first started writing my personal website on GitHub pages using a static website builder called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). Jekyll is a great tool for getting started with building a personal portfolio or technical blog, and it served me well for several years. I eventually changed my static site generation tool from Jekyll to Nuxt since I wanted to learn more about Vue.js. Also, I don't know Ruby very well, and it was difficult for me to use the Jekyll templating language. 

### GitHub Pages

I host my website on GitHub pages at the following domain: [briancaffey.github.io](https://briancaffey.github.io). GitHub pages is a great way to host a public site. The subdomain, `briancaffey` in my case, is your GitHub username.
