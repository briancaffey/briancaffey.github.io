I found an interesting [photogrammetry tutorial](http://wedidstuff.heavyimage.com/index.php/2013/07/12/open-source-photogrammetry-workflow/) and decided to take a shot at building a 3D model of a sun hat. Here's the result:

And here is an interactive model that you can view in 3D:

<div margin="auto" class="sketchfab-embed-wrapper"><iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/ff952a9d9cae4d26a178ad74e099e96b/embed" frameborder="0" allowvr allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>
