In my last article we set up Tensorflow with Docker. Next I want to try to get Tensorboard running.

When we opened the Jupyter notebook, our command included port mapping. Here is that command:

```
$ sudo nvidia-docker run -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu
```

Tensorboard will be served in our browser on port `6006`, so we will want to do that port mapping in our `nvidia-docker` command:

```
sudo nvidia-docker run -p 0.0.0.0:6006:6006 -it tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu bash
```

I want to run [this script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py) from the Tensorflow github repo. It is an example of MNIST with summaries. Summaries are logs that are captured from script and they provide the data that runs Tensorboard. In this case they are recorded in `/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/logs/`.

To start with this script let's just copy and paste it into a file. We will need to add vim to our docker container for that:

```
# apt-get update
# apt-get install vim
```

Now we can copy and paste the script and run it:

The script completed successfully! Now we can can take a look at what happened during the training. Launch Tensorboard with the following command:

```
root@eb9e069064d7:~# tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/tensorflow/mnist/logs/
TensorBoard 0.4.0rc2 at http://eb9e069064d7:6006 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Now we can simply navigate to `localhost:6006` in our browser to start using Tensorboard. Here's a screenshot of Tensorboard showing accuracy:

This wasn't too bad. The MNIST example included a very nice script with everything set up properly. My next big challenge is to implement some type of learning model with a data set of my own and visualize it with TensorBoard, but I'll have to go through several examples before then.
