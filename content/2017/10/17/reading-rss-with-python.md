On my other personal website, [briancaffey.com](briancaffey.com), I have a blog. The content on that blog has mostly mirrored what I put on this github pages site, [briancaffey.github.io](briancaffey.github.io). I want to display my most recent blog posts from briancaffey.github.io on briancaffey.com, and to do this I will be using the RSS feed that comes with a Jekyll site. This should be pretty simple, we are going to use the `requests` librrary, as well as the `feedparser` library.

Here are some [docs](https://wiki.python.org/moin/RssLibraries) on how to use `feedparser`, it is very simple.

First, install it with:

```python
pip install feedparser
```

Here's the setup that I will be using in utility a function that will be imported to `views.py` and called in the `home()` function that renders the homepage for briancaffey.com:

```
import feedparser

def get_blog_posts(number_of_posts):
    url = "http://briancaffey.github.io/feed"
    feed = feedparser.parse(url)
    posts = feed['items'][:number_of_posts]
    return posts

```

Next, in `views.py`, we just need to import the function, call it with the number of articles we want to show, save the returned value to a variable and then pass that to `context`:

```python
from utils import get_blog_posts
def home(request):
    ...
    posts = get_blog_posts(4)

    context = {
        ...
        'recent_posts': posts,
        ...
    }

    return render(request, 'home.html', context)
```

In the context, we can access the following data for each item:

| content                | description                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| item[ "date" ]         | "2004-02-13T22:28:23+08:00" - ISO 8601 date |
| item[ "date_parsed" ]  | (2004,02,13,14,28,23,4,44,0)                |
| item[ "title" ]        | title for item                              |
| item[ "summary" ]      | change summary                              |
| item[ "link" ]         | URL to the page                             |
| item[ "wiki_diff" ]    | for wiki, a link to the diff for the page   |
| item[ "wiki_history" ] | for wiki, a link to the page history        |

That's it!
