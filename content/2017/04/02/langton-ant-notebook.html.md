This is an old project that I would like to refactor. I'm copying the contents of [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/briancaffey/cellular-automata/blob/master/ants.ipynb) into this article with the `jupyter nbconvert ants.ipynb --to markdown`.

This notebook explores a type of Turing Machine known as [termites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite). The first part is a script I wrote a few years ago when I was first learning Python. If you are new to learning Python, I suggest you give it a try before reading the script; there's a lot you will learn about flow control and data structures. My script is far from perfect and every time I come back to it there is an idiom I can add and areas that can be refactored and cleaned up. It generates images of 2-dimensional n-state termites on an $a$ x $b$ rectangular grid, or it can generate multiple images (frames) of a single termite as it grows to make a video. Here's an example of a termite animatino that I made using the script below:

The type of termite explored here is a modified version of a type of cellular automata known as [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant). Langton's Ant has a simple ruleset: an ant is placed on a 2-dimensional grid of 2-state cells (black or white) with a directional orientation. If the ant is on a black cell at $t=n$, the ant enters the cell on the immediate left at $t=n+1$ and the state of the cell it exits changes to white. If the state of the cell that the ant enters is white, the ant enters the cell immediately to the right and the cell it exits turns black. Around 11,000 steps, the ant enters a 'highway' which results in a repeated motion that moves the ant continually in one direction.

Instead of black and white cells, we can define $n$ number of states (colors) and assign any combination of $n$ instructions (eg. LRLLLRLLLRL). The script below generates generates an arbitrary number of `ants`. Each number in `range(ants)` is converted to binary and then 1s and 0s of the corresponding binary number represent the left and right turns for each individual ant. For example: `bin(23)` corresponds to a 5-state ant with the following rules: RLRRR. This method avoids generating isotropes (RLRRR is the same ant as LRLLL).

If `record` is set to `True`, one frame will be captured every `frame_interval` number of steps. These images can be converted into video easily with open-source programs like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).

The last part of the notebook attempts to use new methods from the latest version of scikit-learn ([0.18.1](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new.html)) to cluster ants by their behavior: k-means (for clustering) and Isolation Forests (for detecting outliers).

# Clustering

We now have a csv file where each row is a 16-state termite and the columns labeled 0 through 15 count the sum of pixels in each state (the different colors). With `last_step` we also track the last step reached in the event that the ant runs into the edge of the grid. This will be helpful in clustering ants that form highways in different groups from those that complete 100000 steps inside the 200 x 200 grid.

First let's read the csv into a pandas DataFrame and look at some of the data.

```python
import PIL
from PIL import Image
import random
import os
import sys
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import scipy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from __future__ import print_function
from sklearn import cluster
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
```

```python
os.chdir(os.path.expanduser('~/Documents/CA_1/'))
df1 = pd.read_csv('ants_hist_.csv')
```

```python
df1.shape
```

    (32768, 18)

```python
df1.sample(3)
```

There are 32768 unique instructions for 16-state termites `(2^16)/2 = 32768`. Let's check to see how many of these are duplicates. We want to select only the state-counts and then call `.drop_duplicates` on that DataFrame.

```python
df2 = df1.iloc[:,0:16]
```

```python
df2.shape[0] - df2.drop_duplicates().shape[0]
```

    1566

1566 of the 16-state termites. It might be helpful to remove these termites from the DataFrame before we cluster them.

```python
unique_termites_index = df2.drop_duplicates().index
```

```python
df = df1.loc[unique_termites_index,:]
```

```python
df['steps_taken'] = [100000 if x==0 else x for x in df.last_step]
df['file_names'] = [x+'.png' for x in df.moves]
df['move_len'] = [len(x) for x in df.moves]

Here's a quick look at the distribution of the base canvas color (red in the images below) over all of the unique termites.

```python
x = '0'
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
df[(df[x]>0)][x].hist(bins=250)
plt.xlabel('Count of Cells in state 0')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Histogram Showing Termite Count by number of cells in state 0')
```

```python
df.shape
```

    (31202, 21)

Now we can prepare a DataFrame that we will feed in to the clustering model. We will take only the pixel counts and the total number of steps taken.

```python
X = df[df.move_len==16].iloc[:,[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,18]]
```

```python
X.columns
```

    Index([u'0', u'1', u'10', u'11', u'12', u'13', u'14', u'15', u'2', u'3', u'4',
           u'5', u'6', u'7', u'8', u'9', u'steps_taken'],
          dtype='object')

Most of the termites completed all 100000 steps within the grid boundries.

```python
X[X.steps_taken==100000].steps_taken.count()
```

    29955

Here'a a histogram of the steps taken by ants that took less than 100000 steps.

```python
X[X.steps_taken<100000].steps_taken.hist()
plt.title('Histogram of steps_taken for termites that stayed in bounds')
plt.xlabel('steps_taken')
plt.ylabel('Count')
```

Here's another look at the distribution of cells in state 3 over all termites:

```python
x = '3' #other intereting states: 1, 7, 11, 15
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
#plt.figure(figsize=(12,8))
df[(df[x]>0)][x].hist(bins=100)
plt.xlabel('Count of Cells in state 3')
plt.ylabel('Count (termites)')
plt.title('Histogram Showing Termite Count by number of cells in state 3')
```

```python

```

    (31202, 17)

To cluster the different termites, we can use an unsupervised learning method called clustering. It is "unsupervised" because I don't explicitly tell the model what types termites should be grouped together. Instead, we will tell the model _how many different clusters there are._ Of course, I really don't know how many clusters there should be. I do know from looking at the results that there seem to be many different types of behavior, patterns, sizes and other characteristics. We significantly reduce the complexity of clustering task by training the model on the count of pixels by what state the are in. I'm sure that the model won't be able to pick up on all of the nuances that humans can detect by looking at the images, but I have a feeling that it should be able to do a fairly good job. After we take a look at the individual clusters, we can try to find an optimal number of clusters by minimizing the total number of outliers of all the clusters. Here's [an interesting paper](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5306-on-integrated-clustering-and-outlier-detection.pdf) on integrated clustering and outlier detection.

Here's how we set up the clustering model. For the numebr of clusters, let's start with 75.

```python
k_means = cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=75, random_state=1)
```

```python
k_means.fit(X, y=None)
```

    KMeans(algorithm='auto', copy_x=True, init='k-means++', max_iter=300,
        n_clusters=75, n_init=10, n_jobs=1, precompute_distances='auto',
        random_state=1, tol=0.0001, verbose=0)

Then we add the cluster number to each termite:

```python
X['clusters'] = k_means.labels_
```

Here's the breakdown of clusters by number of termites in each cluster:

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(12,4))
plt.bar(X.clusters.value_counts().index, X.clusters.value_counts())
plt.xlabel('Cluster Number')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Termite count by cluster')
```

And here is a list of the data shown above:

```python
for x, y in zip(X.clusters.value_counts().index, X.clusters.value_counts()): print(' || cluster_num: ' + str(x) , 'count: ' + str(y), end='  ')
```

```python
cluster_dict = {x: y for x, y in zip(X.clusters.value_counts().index, X.clusters.value_counts())}
```

Now let's have a look at some of the termite clusters. We can use matplotlib and PIL to display multiple images using subplots.

```python
#variables to manage the arrangement and spacing of cluster images
total = 0
rows = 0
im_length = 0

#set variables for cluster images based on cluster size
def set_spacing(files):
    global total
    global rows
    global im_length
    #columns = 6
    total = len(files)
    extras = len(files) % 6
    if extras > 0:
        total += (6 - extras)
    rows = total/6.
    im_length = rows*(20/9.)

#use matplotlib to show images loaded with PIL
def show_images(cluster_num, samples = 0,  files_bool=False, files=None):
    if files_bool==True:
        files1 = np.random.choice(files.index, min(files.shape[0], samples), replace=False)
    if (samples == 0) & (files_bool==False):
        files1 = X[X.clusters==cluster_num].index
    if (samples > 0) & (files_bool==False):
        files1 = np.random.choice(X[X.clusters==cluster_num].index, min(cluster_dict[cluster_num],samples), replace=False)
    set_spacing(files1)
    plt.figure(figsize = (14,im_length))
    os.chdir(os.path.expanduser('~/Documents/CA_1/imgs/'))
    for num, x in enumerate(files1):
        img = PIL.Image.open(x)
        plt.subplot(rows,6,num+1)
        plt.title(x.split('.')[0])
        plt.axis('off')
        plt.imshow(img)
    print('Cluster #' + str(X.ix[x].clusters) + ' -- Cluster Total: ' + str(cluster_dict[X.ix[x].clusters]))
```

The vast majority of termites seem to form nondescript blobs after 100000 steps. There are perhaps many thousands of termites that didn't yet reach a . Setting the clusters parameter to 75 is probably too high. Many of the groups have similar behaviour. There were several cluster groups that formed 'highways'. It may make more sense to filter out these termites and cluster termites that didn't form highways.

# Outlier Detection

It could also be interesting to see how many outliers are present in each cluster for various values of k in the k-means algorithm. This may help us choose a more fitting number of clusters by which the termites can be grouped. here's how we could do that:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
```

```python
X_ = X.loc[X.clusters==37, :] #16
```

```python
X_ = X.loc[X.clusters==37, :]
```

```python
clf = IsolationForest(max_samples=100, random_state=rng)
clf.fit(X_)

y_pred_train = clf.predict(X_)

```

```python
y_pred_train.mean()
```

    0.79922779922779918

The following values gives us the average of the predicted values (1 for inlier, -1 for outlier), so this value doesn't correspond to a percentage accuracy. The accuracy is about 89% (the model determined that 89% of termites in cluster 37 are inliers and the remaining 11% are outliers.

```python
X_['anom'] = y_pred_train
```

```python
X_.anom.value_counts()
```

     1    466
    -1     52
    Name: anom, dtype: int64

Let's compare some of the inliers with the outliers:

```python
files_normal = X_[X_.anom==(1)]
show_images(0, samples = 24, files_bool=True, files=files_normal)
```

    Cluster #37 -- Cluster Total: 518

![png](/static/ants_files/ants_92_1.png)

```python
files_abnormal = X_[X_.anom==(-1)]
show_images(0, samples = 24, files_bool=True, files=files_abnormal)
```

    Cluster #37 -- Cluster Total: 518

![png](/static/ants_files/ants_93_1.png)

This sample of outliers seems to have slightly different characteristics compared with the inlier sample. This can be seen in the patches of solid colors (pink, purple, teal, grey).

# Conclusion

Using k-means and Isolation Forests with this set of over 30,000 termites offers a quick and easy way to sort out major trends that these deterministic systems display. As you can see in the cluster samples above, the classification is far from perfect. Some near-identical termites are in different clusters. It would be interesting to tweak some aspects of this experiment in the future:

- Larger number of states (>16)
- More steps (>100000) / bigger grid
- Random "noise" on the grid at step 0
- Variation on the rules
- Segmenting 'highway' termites before clustering
