Thai kings, particularly King Rama I, adapted and documented the Ramakien, giving it a prominent place in Thai history. Lavishly detailed murals surrounding the Temple of the Emerald Buddha in Bangkok’s Grand Palace depict the Ramakien in over 178 panels that totaling over 2 kilometers in length. On a recent visit to the Grand Palace, I imagined having an application that could link the detailed murals to elements of the story in Hindi, Thai, English, Chinese or any language.",[15,2215,2216],{},[59,2217],{"alt":2218,"src":2219},"Ramakien murals surrounding Temple of the Emerald Buddha","/static/redlm/ramakien.png",[15,2221,2222],{},"The Dream of the Red Chamber, originally titled The Story of the Stone, is one of China’s greatest literary works and a masterpiece of world literature. The novel begins with a frame story centered on a magical stone, left over from the Chinese creation myth where the goddess Nuwa mends the heavens. Longing to experience the human world, the sentient stone persuades a Buddhist monk and a Taoist priest to reincarnate it as a boy. This boy, Baoyu, is born into a wealthy and influential family—a character partly based on the author, Cao Xueqin, and his own aristocratic upbringing. Through Baoyu's life, friendships, and romantic relationships, the novel delves into his family’s gradual decline, mirroring the instability of China’s own noble families in the late Qing dynasty. The story also portrays the era's customs, social structures, and beliefs, offering readers a richly detailed exploration of life in Qing China.",[15,2224,2225],{},"It was a lot of fun to work on this project with tools from LlamaIndex and NVIDIA.

The painting likely visually represents the scene from the book where a monk and a Taoist are chatting at the foot of Qinggeng Peak. The two elderly figures in the painting may represent the monk and Taoist from the book, discussing their discovery of a bright and pristine stone, and planning to take it to a bustling, splendid place for a happy life. The painting’s elements—mountains, peaks, flowing water, trees, and rocks—might echo the book's descriptions, illustrating the natural environment at the base of Qinggeng Peak where the monk and Taoist reside. The painting’s tranquil and harmonious atmosphere may also align with the storyline, expressing the monk and Taoist's care for the stone and their wish for it to live a happy life.
