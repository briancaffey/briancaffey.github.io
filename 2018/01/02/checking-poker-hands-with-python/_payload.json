While solving the problem I aimed worked through to the end leaving some parts to come back to that I felt confident in solving. Instead of writing each function to check differnt hands at the beginning, I filled most of these functions with ",[37,954,955],{},"pass"," and moved on to write the next part that involves checking each different combination of cards.
