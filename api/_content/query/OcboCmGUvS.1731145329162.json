Red Dead Redemption and Genshin Impact are two massively popular games of this type. There might be an interesting project idea that could use LLMs and RAG (retrieval augmented generation), but I don't play these types of games and it didn't seem practical for a project that would be built in just over a month.

Rocket League's in-game chat inspired the idea for my submission to NVIDIA's Generative AI Developer Contest: Rocket League BotChat.

These bots are very good, but they are not infallible. My contest project idea was now clear: develop a plugin for Rocket League capable of sending messages from bot players.

The local environment (the developer's computer) should be a close proxy for the production environment where the code will ultimately deployed to for end users. For this project the local development environment is our PC itself, which simplifies things.
