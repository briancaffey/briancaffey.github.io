The focus will be on the technical implementation of building ad hoc environments using specific set of tools (including AWS ECS, Terraform and GitHub Actions). I will also be giving context on the high-level implementation decisions based on what I think are best practices guided by the [12-Factor Application methodology](https:\u002F\u002F12factor.net\u002F). If any of this interests you, please have a read and let me know what you think in the comments on the outlets where I'll be sharing this article (links at the end).\n\n## GitHub Links\n\nThis article references three open-source code repositories on GitHub:\n\n- [django-step-by-step](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fdjango-step-by-step)\n  - this repo contains an example microblogging application called Î¼blog\n  - includes complete GitHub Action examples for automating creation, updating and destruction of ad hoc environments\n\n- [terraform-aws-django](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fterraform-aws-django)\n  - a collection of modules for running Django applications on AWS using Terraform, including ad hoc environments\n  - this module has been published to Terraform Registry\n\n- [terraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fterraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments)\n  - a Terraform module that provides shared infrastructure used by ad hoc environments (VPC, RDS instance, bastion host, etc.)\n  - this module has also been published to Terraform Registry\n  - this module is designed to be used with the `terraform-aws-django` module\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThere are all sorts of applications, and all sort of engineering teams. For some context on what I'm describing in this article, here are some basic assumptions that I'm making about a fictional application and developed by a fictional engineering team:\n\n- engineering team is composed of a backend team, a frontend team, a devops team and works closely with a product team\n- backend team primarily develops an API\n- frontend team develops an JavaScript SPA (frontend website)\n- SPA consumes backend API\n- product team frequently needs to demo applications to prospective clients\n- development teams don't have deep expertise in infrastructure, containers, CI\u002FCD or automation\n- devops team has some knowledge of the application and is responsible for building automation that will allow anyone on the team to quickly spin up a complete environment for either testing or demoing purposes\n\nHere are assumptions about specific tools and technologies used at the company:\n\n- backend is a REST API developed with Django and a Postgres database\n- backend is packaged into a docker container\n- frontend is also packaged into a docker container using multi-stage builds and NGINX\n- frontend does not require any build-time configuration (all configuration needed by frontend is fetched from backend)\n- backend application's configuration is driven by plain-text environment variables at run-time\n- engineering team uses AWS\n- automation pipeline exists for building, tagging and pushing backend and frontend containers to an ECR repository\n- devops team uses AWS ECS for running containerized workloads\n- devops team uses Terraform for provisioning infrastructure\n- devops team uses GitHub Actions for building automation pipelines\n- team is somewhat cost-conscious\n\n## What are ad hoc environments?\n\nAd hoc environments are short-lived environments that are designed to be used for testing a specific set of features or for demoing a specific application configuration in an isolated environment. It is intended to be a functional duplicate of the main production environment. An ad hoc environment is the first cloud environment that the application code will be deployed to after a developer has been working on it in a local development environment.\n\n## Trade-offs to make when designing ad hoc environment infrastructure and automation\n\nWhen building infrastructure and workflows for ad hoc environments, there are a few things to solve for:\n\n- startup speed\n- shared vs isolated resources\n- total cost of ownership\n- automation complexity\n- degree of similarity to production environments\n\nLet's look at these items by considering how we can set up the main infrastructure components that will be used to run our ad hoc application environments.\n\n### Relational Databases\n\nStartup speed can be measured by the time between when an environment is requested and when that environment can be used. In this period of time, an automation pipeline may do the following:\n\n- run `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` to build infrastructure\n- run scripts to prepare the application such as database migrations\n- seeding initial sample data with a script or database dump\n- message the user with information about the environment (URLs, commands for accessing an interactive shell, etc.)\n\nRDS instances can take a long time to create relative to other AWS resources such as S3 buckets and IAM roles. RDS and ElastiCache instances are also more costly than other resources. We could use a single, shared RDS instance placed in a private subnet of a shared VPC. Each ad hoc environment could use a different named database in the RDS instance in the form `{ad-hoc-env-name}-db`. Using one RDS instance per ad hoc environment would be slow to startup and tear down and also costly if there are many developers using ad hoc environments simultaneously.\n\nIf we choose to isolate the application's relational database at the databases level (and not the RDS instance level), then we will need our automation workflow to create a database per ad hoc environment.\n\nLet's spin up a simple example to illustrate how this would would work.\n\n- A developer is working on `feature-abc` that involves a significant refactor of the data model.\n- The developer decides to spin up an ad hoc environment called `feature-abc`.\n- Our automation will need to create a database in the RDS instance called `feature-abc`.\n- We can configure a bastion host with `psql` installed that has network and security group access to our RDS instance, and we can give our GitHub Actions an SSH key that can be used to run `createdb` over SSH.\n- The automation also runs database migrations once the application has started, and we can view the logs of the database migration to check for any irregularities or other issues.\n- This will give the developer and the rest of team confidence that the promoting `feature-abc` to the next pre-production environments will not have any errors.\n- The developer may even choose to load a SQL dump of the next pre-production environment into their `feature-abc` database get even more confidence that there will be no data integrity errors.\n- When the developer's PR is merged and approved, the ad hoc environment `feature-abc` can be destroyed, including the `feature-abc` database in the shared RDS instance.\n\nWith this approach we won't incur the costs of multiple RDS instances. Ad hoc environments will start up faster because an RDS instance per environment is not required. We do have slightly less resource isolation, and we need to introduce a bastion host, but I consider this an acceptable trade-off.\n\n### Redis (key-value database)\n\nRedis is used in the application and it plays a few different roles:\n\n- primarily, it is a caching layer that can cache request responses to reduce load on the database and speed up our application\n- it is a message broker for our async task workers (celery)\n- if web sockets are used (I don't use them in the sample application), redis can be used as the backend that coordinates socket messages\n- it can be used as a backend for other pluggable Django apps that our main application may need to use (such as django-constance, for example)\n\nAWS offers a managed Redis service called ElastiCache. An ElastiCache instance can do database isolation similar to how RDS can can database isolation as we discussed previously, but there are some key differences:\n\n- redis databases are numbered, not named\n- the backend application uses isolated numbered databases for the different redis use cases that I just mentioned (for example: celery uses database `0`, our API caching layer uses database `1`, etc.)\n\nThis makes it difficult to use a single ElastiCache instance for our ad hoc environments since we would need to figure out which numbered database to assign to a specific role for each ad hoc environment (e.g. how do we know which numbered database to use for the API caching for the `feature-abc` ad hoc environment). [Is this correct? I couldn't find any other way to use namespaces or isolation in redis.]\n\nSo how can we approach providing isolated redis instances for multiple ad hoc environments? My solution is to run our own redis as a stateful service in ECS. Before we dig into how to do this, we need to talk about another important part of our application: compute.\n\n### Compute\n\nOur backend application is composed of a few different services that all share the same code base. In other words, our backend's services uses the same docker image but run different processes for each component: gunicorn for the core API, celery for the task workers and celerybeat for task scheduling. If our application used websockets, we could have another service that runs an asgi server process (like daphne or uvicorn).\n\nSince our backend application is packaged into a container and we are using AWS as our cloud provider, ECS is a great choice for running our backend services. ECS is a container orchestration tool that I usually describe as a nice middle ground between docker swarm and Kubernetes. Simply put, it is a flexible option for running our containerized services that make up our backend application.\n\nUsing ECS you can choose to run containers on EC2 instances that you can manage, or you can run containers using Fargate. Fargate is a serverless compute option that takes care of managing the underlying \"computer\" that our containers run on. All of our backend dependencies are defined in our Dockerfile, so there is nothing else we need to worry about installing or managing on the underlying operating system that runs our containers -- AWS handles all of this for us. To use Fargate, we simply tell AWS which containers to run and how much CPU and memory to use in the ECS Task that runs the containers. To scale our app horizontally, the the ECS service that managed ECS tasks simply increases the number of tasks that run. Since we are going to use the Fargate launch type for our ECS Tasks, let's talk about the ergonomics of these serverless compute instances compared to running gunicorn directly on an EC2 instances.\n\n- We can't SSH into the Fargate instance. We can instead use AWS Systems Manager and EcsExec to open an interactive shell in a running backend container. This can be useful for developers who might need to run a management command or access an interactive Django shell to verify behavior in their ad hoc environment.\n\n- We can't simply change code on the server and restart services. This can sometimes be a useful pattern for debugging something that can only be tested on a cloud environment (e.g. something that can't easily be reproduced on your local machine), so this requires that developers push new images to their backend services for every change they want to see reflected on their ad hoc environment. Later on I'll discuss how we can provide tooling for developers to quickly update the image used in their backend services.\n\nWith AWS Fargate, you will pay more than you would for a comparable amount of CPU and memory on EC2. Similar to EC2 spot instances, Fargate offers interruptable instances called Fargate Spot which costs significantly less than regular Fargate instances. Fargate spot is appropriate for our ad hoc environments since ad hoc environments are non-critical workloads. In the event that a Fargate spot instance is interrupted, the ECS service will automatically launch another Fargate task to replace the task that was stopped.\n\nECS with Fargate is ideal for running the stateless services that make up our backend application. Each ad hoc environment will include an ECS cluster that groups ECS services together.\n\n### Redis, revisited\n\nWe can run redis as an ECS service instead of using ElastiCache. In order to do this, we will need our backend services (gunicorn, celery and celerybeat) to be able to communicate with a fourth ECS service that will run be running redis (using an official redis image from Docker Hub, or a redis image that we define in ECR).\n\nBy default, there is no way for our backend services to know how to communicate with another service in our ECS cluster. If you have used docker-compose, you may know that you can use the service name `redis` as the hostname so that a backend service can communicate with redis. To achieve this in AWS, we need some way to manage a DNS record that points to the private IP of the Fargate task that is running redis in our ECS cluster. Such a service exists in AWS and it is called Cloud Map. Cloud Map offers service discovery so that our backend services can make network calls to a static DNS address that will reliably point to the correct private IP.\n\nWe can define a service discovery namespace (which will essentially be a top level domain, or TLD) that all of our ad hoc environments can share. Let's assume this namespace is called `ad-hoc`. Each ad hoc environment can then define a service discovery service in the shared namespace for redis that is called `{ad-hoc-env-name}-redis`. This way, we can have a reliable address that we can use for our backend configuration (environment variables) that will look like this: `redis:\u002F\u002F{ad-hoc-env-name}-redis.ad-hoc:6379\u002F0`. `{ad-hoc-env-name-redis}.ad-hoc` will be the hostname of the redis service, and Route 53 will create records that point `{ad-hoc-env-name}-redis.ad-hoc` to the private IP of the redis Fargate task for each ad hoc environment.\n\n### Load Balancing\n\nWe now have our backend services running on Fargate spot instances, and they can communicate with the redis service in our ECS cluster using service discovery that we configured with Cloud Map. We still need to think about a few things:\n\n- how will we expose our API service to the public (or private) internet\n- how will we expose our frontend application to the public (or private) internet\n- how will we make sure that requests go the correct ECS services\n\nApplication load balancers (ALBs) are a great way to expose web app traffic to the internet. We could either have one application load balancer per ad hoc environment, or one application load balancer shared between all ad hoc environments. ALBs are somewhat slow to create and they also incur a significant monthly cost, so using a shared ALB for all ad hoc environments would be preferable.\n\nIndividual ad hoc environments can then create target groups and listener rules for a shared ALB for each service that needs to serve requests from the internet. In our case this is the backend API server and the frontend server that serves our static frontend site using NGINX.\n\nECS services that need to be exposed to the internet can specify the target group, port and container to use for load balancing. A target group is created that defines the health check and other settings, and a load balancer listener rule is created on the shared load balancer that will forward traffic matching certain conditions to the target group for our service.\n\nFor a given ad hoc environment, we need to specify that only traffic with certain paths should be sent to the backend service, and all other traffic should be sent to the frontend service. For example, we may only want to send traffic that start with the path `\u002Fapi` or `\u002Fadmin` to the backend target group.\n\n## More on shared resources vs per-environment resources\n\nUp until now we have discussed infrastructure design decisions at a high level, but we have not yet talked about how to organize our infrastructure as code. At a basic level, components of our ad hoc environment either fall into shared infrastructure or infrastructure that is specific to an individual ad hoc environment. Here's a list of the resources that are shared and the resources that are specific to each ad hoc environment.\n\nShared resources include:\n\n- VPC\n- IAM policies\n- Security groups\n- RDS instance\n- Service Discovery namespace\n- Application Load Balancer\n- Bastion host\n\nAd hoc environment resources include:\n\n- ECS Cluster\n- ECS Tasks and Services (for backend and frontend applications)\n- ECS Tasks for running management commands (such as migrate)\n- CloudWatch logging groups for containers defined in ECS Tasks\n- ALB Target groups\n- ALB listener rules\n- Route 53 record that points to the load balancer (e.g. `ad-hoc-env-name.example.com`)\n- S3 bucket for static and media assets\n- Service Discovery Service for redis service in ECS cluster\n\nShared resources can be defined in one terraform configuration and deployed once. These resources will be long-lived as long as the application is under active development and the team requires on-demand provisioning of ad hoc environments.\n\nAd hoc environment resources can be defined in another terraform configuration that references outputs from the shared resource configuration using `terraform_remote_state`. Each ad hoc environment can be defined by a `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file that contains the name of the ad hoc environment (such as `brian`, `brian2`, `demo-feature-abc`, etc.). This `\u003Cname\u003E` value will also be the name of the Terraform workspace and will be used to name and tag AWS resources associated with the corresponding ad hoc environment.\n\nThe `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file will allow developers to use a simple, standard file interface for defining application specific values, such as the version of the backend and frontend. This brings developers into the concepts and practices of \"infrastructure as code\" and \"configuration as code\" and also helps the entire team keep track of how different environments are configured.\n\nAd hoc environment `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` files are stored in a directory of a special git repository that also defines the ad hoc environment terraform configuration. Currently, the `tfvars` files are stored [here](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fdjango-step-by-step\u002Ftree\u002Fmain\u002Fterraform\u002Flive\u002Fdev).\n\nNow let's look at the two terraform configurations used for defining shared resources and ad hoc environment resources.\n\n## Diagram\n\nHere's an overview of the resources used for the ad hoc environments. The **letters represent shared resources** and the **numbers represent per-environment resources**.\n\n![png](\u002Fstatic\u002Fadhoc.png)\n\n### Shared architecture\n\nA. VPC (created using the [official AWS VPC Module](https:\u002F\u002Fregistry.terraform.io\u002Fmodules\u002Fterraform-aws-modules\u002Fvpc\u002Faws\u002Flatest))\n\nB. Public subnets for bastion host, NAT Gateways and Load Balancer\n\nC. Private subnets for application workloads and RDS\n\nD. Application Load Balancer that is shared between all ad hoc environments. A pre-provisioned wildcard ACM certificate is attached to the load balancer that is used to secure traffic for load-balanced ECS services\n\nE. Service discovery namespace that provides a namespace for application workloads to access the redis service running in ECS\n\nF. IAM roles needed for ECS tasks to access AWS services\n\nG. RDS instance using postgres engine that is shared between all ad hoc environments\n\nH. Bastion host used to access RDS from GitHub Actions (needed for creating per-environment databases)\n\nI. NAT Gateway used to give traffic in private subnets a route to the public internet\n\n### Environment-specific architecture\n\n1. ECS Cluster that groups all ECS tasks for a single ad hoc environment\n2. Listener rules and target groups that direct traffic from the load balancer to the ECS services for an ad hoc environment.\n3. Redis service running in ECS that provides caching and serves as a task broker for celery\n4. Route53 records that point to the load balancer\n5. Frontend service that serves the Vue.js application over NGINX\n6. API service that serves the backend with Gunicorn\n7. Celery worker that process jobs in the default queue\n8. Celery beat that schedules celery tasks\n9. `collectstatic` task\n10. `migrate` task\n11. CloudWatch log groups are created for each ECS task in an ad hoc environment\n12. Each ad hoc environment gets a database in the shared RDS instance\n\n\n## Shared resources terraform configuration\n\nLet's have a detailed look at the terraform configuration for shared resources that will support ad hoc environments.\n\n![Shared AWS resources for ad hoc environment](\u002Fimage\u002Fshared-resources.png)\n\n### VPC\n\nWe can use the [AWS VPC module](https:\u002F\u002Fregistry.terraform.io\u002Fmodules\u002Fterraform-aws-modules\u002Fvpc\u002Faws\u002Flatest) for creating the shared VPC with Terraform. This module provides a high level interface that will provision lots of the components that are needed for a VPC following best practices, and it is less code for the DevOps team to manage.\n\n### Cloud Map Service Discovery Namespace\n\nCloud Map is used in order to allow services in our ECS cluster to communicate with each other. The only reason that Cloud Map is needed is so that the backend services (API, celery workers, beat) can communicate with Redis, which will be an important service for our application, providing caching and also serving as a broker for celery. If we were to use Django Channels for websockets, the Redis service would also function as the backend for Django Channels.\n\nWe will only need to specify `service_registries` on the redis service in our ECS cluster. What this will do is provide an address that our other services can use to communicate with redis. This address is created in the form of a Route 53 record, and it points to the private IP address of the redis service. If the private IP of the redis service is updated, the Route 53 record record for our redis service will be updated as well.\n\nIn order for service discovery to work in the VPC that we created, we need to add the following options to the terraform AWS VPC module:\n\n\n    # DNS settings\n    enable_dns_hostnames = true\n    enable_dns_support   = true\n\n### Security Groups\n\nThere are two important security groups that we will set up as part of the shared infrastructure layer to be used by each ad hoc environment: one security group for the load balancer, and one security group where all of our ECS services will run.\n\nThe load balancer security group will allow all traffic on port `80` and `443` for `HTTP` and `HTTPS` traffic. The ECS security group will only allow inbound traffic from the application load balancer security group.\n\n### IAM Roles\n\nThere are two important IAM roles that we will need for our ECS tasks. We need a task execution role that our ECS tasks will use to interact with other AWS services, such as S3, Secrets Manager, etc.\n\n### RDS Instance\n\nWe will create one RDS instance in one of the private subnets in our VPC. This RDS instance will have one Postgres database per ad hoc environment. This RDS instance has a security group that allows all traffic from our ECS security group.\n\n### Load Balancer\n\nWe will use one load balancer for all ad hoc environments. This load balancer will have a wildcard ACM certificate attached to it (`*.dev.example.com`, for example). Each ad hoc environment will create a Route 53 record that will point to this load balancer's public DNS name. For example, `brian.dev.example.com` will be the address of my ad hoc environment. Requests to this address will then be routed to either the frontend ECS service or the backend ECS service depending on request header values that will be set on the listener rules.\n\nBy default, a load balancer supports up to 50 listener rules, so we can create plenty of ad hoc environments before we need to increase the default quota. There will be a discussion at the end of this article about AWS service quotas.\n\n### Bastion Host\n\nThe bastion host will be created in one of the VPC's public subnets. This will primarily be used for connecting to RDS to create new databases for new ad hoc environments, or for manually manipulating data in an ad hoc environment for debugging.\n\n## Environment-specific resources\n\nNow that we have defined a shared set of infrastructure that our ad hoc environments will use, let's have a look at the resources that will be specific to ad hoc environments that will be added on top of the shared resources.\n\n### ECS Cluster\n\nThe ECS Cluster is a simple grouping of ECS tasks and services.\n\n### ECS Tasks and Services\n\nEach environment will have a unique collection of ECS tasks and services that will be used to run the application.\n\nThere are four important ECS services in our application that are used to run \"long-running\" ECS tasks. Long-running tasks are tasks that start processes that run indefinitely, rather than running until completion. The long-running tasks in our application include:\n\n- backend web application (gunciron web server)\n- backend celery worker\n- backend celery beat\n- frontend web site\n- redis\n\nThe infrastructure code also defines some tasks that are not long-running but rather short lived tasks that run until completion and do not start again. These services include:\n\n- collectstatic\n- database migrations\n- any other ad-hoc task that we want to run, usually wrapped in a Django management command\n\n### ALB Listener Rules and Target Groups\n\nThese two resources work together to expose certain ECS tasks to the internet. The pattern used to do this involves:\n\n- creating an `aws_lb_target_group` that define a `health_check`, references a VPC and a port\n- defining a `load_balancer` block on an `aws_ecs_service` resource that references the `aws_lb_target_group`\n- an `aws_lb_listener_rule` rule is defined to forward traffic matching certain hostname, path or header values that we define to the `aws_lb_target_group`\n\n### Route 53 record\n\nThe Route 53 resource we create for ad hoc environment will define a subdomain that will use for the ad hoc environment, such as `brian.example.dev` (where `example.dev` is a domain name used internally by the DevOps team). The load balancer created as part of the shared resources will have a wildcard certificate that will give us secure connections for URLs following the pattern `*.example.dev`.\n\n### S3 bucket\n\nAn S3 bucket will be provisioned per ad hoc environment. This S3 bucket will store both static files as well as media uploads (images).\n\n### Database within RDS instance\n\nWe will create one database in our RDS instance per ad hoc environment for data isolation.\n\n### terraform_remote_state\n\n[`terraform_remote_state`](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.terraform.io\u002Flanguage\u002Fstate\u002Fremote-state-data) is a feature of terraform that will allow us to separate the shared infrastructure terraform configuration ([link]()) from the ad hoc environment terraform infrastructure ([link]()).\n\nOur terraform configuration for ad hoc environments will define variables that will be provided by `terraform_remote_state` that will reference values from our shared resource terraform configuration. This is what that looks like in Terraform code:\n\n```hcl\n```\n\n## How to setup an ad hoc environment\n\nNow that we have been over the resources that will be created to support our ad hoc environments, let's talk about how we can enable individuals on our team to create and update ad hoc environments.\n\n### Design decisions\n\nThe devops team will decide on the interface that will be used for creating an ad hoc environment. Since we are using Terraform, this interface will be a Terraform configuration. The minimum amount of information that our ad hoc environment configuration needs is image tags for the frontend and backend images to use. Other configurations will be provided by default values set in `variables.tf`, and these defaults can easily be overridden by passing values to `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`. I'm choosing to use `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` as the way to pass configuration values to our ad hoc environments where `\u003Cname\u003E` is the name of the ad hoc environment being created. This will give us the following benefits:\n\n- all ad hoc environments will be visible to the entire team in git since each ad hoc environment will have a `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file associated with it\n- adding additional customization to an ad hoc environment does not add additional complexity to our automation pipeline since all customization is added through a single file that will be referenced by `$WORKSPACE.tfvars`\n\nThe downsides of this approach are:\n\n- creating ad hoc environments requires knowledge of git, so non-technical product team members might need help from the engineering team when setting up an ad hoc environment\n- there is an additional \"manual\" step of creating a `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file that must be done before running a pipeline to create an ad hoc environment\n\nProvided that a `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file has been created and pushed to the correct branch (`main`, for example) of our \"live\" Terraform repo, creating or updating an ad hoc environment will be as simple as running a pipeline in GitHub Actions that specifies the `\u003Cname\u003E` of our ad hoc environment. If no such `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file exists, our pipeline will fail.\n\n### GitHub Action\n\nCreating ad hoc environments will involve manually triggering a GitHub Action that runs on `workflow_dispatch`:\n\n    on:\n      workflow_dispatch:\n        inputs:\n          workspace:\n            description: 'Name of terraform workspace to use'\n            required: true\n            default: 'dev'\n            type: string\n\nWe only have to enter the name of the ad hoc environment we want to create or update. The ad hoc environment name is used as the Terraform workspace name. This name is also the name of the `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file that must be created per environment.\n\nThis workflow will do `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` using the `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file. When everything has been created, we will use the AWS CLI to prepare the environment so that it can be used. We will use the `aws ecs run-task` command to run database migrations needed so that the application code can interact with the database.\n\n## How to update code in an existing ad hoc environment\n\nAssuming that we have deployed an ad hoc environment called `brian` with version `v1.0.0` of the backend application and `v2.0.0` of the frontend application, let's think about the process of updating the application to `v1.1.0` of the backend and `v2.1.0` of the frontend.\n\nThe simplest approach to updating the application would be edit the `brian.tfvars` file with the new versions:\n\n    # brian.tfvars\n    be_image_tag = \"v1.1.0\"\n    fe_image_tag = \"v2.1.0\"\n\nIf we run the same pipeline that we initially used to deploy ad hoc environment (with `terraform init`, `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`) against the updated `brian.tfvars` file, this will result in a rolling update of the frontend and backend services ([more on rolling updates here](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.aws.amazon.com\u002FAmazonECS\u002Flatest\u002Fdeveloperguide\u002Fdeployment-type-ecs.html)).\n\nIf there are database migrations included in the new version of the code that is going out, we will need to run the database migrations after the `terraform apply` completes. One of the top level outputs of our ad hov environment terraform configuration includes a complete `run-task` command that will run our database migrations when called from GitHub Actions (or our local machine).\n\n### Order of Operations\n\nFor ad hoc environments, it is probably fine to update the services and then run the database migrations. Ad hoc environments may only have a single \"user\" -- the developer, so **we don't need to worry about any errors that may occur if requests are made against the new version of code before database migrations have been applied**.\n\nLet's consider a simple example to illustrate what can go wrong here. If we add a `total_views` to our blog post model to track the total number of page views a post has, we would add a field to the model, generate migration file with `makemigrations`, and then update our views and model serializers to make use of this new field. In the time between updating our service and running the database migrations, any requests to endpoints that access the new database field will fail since the table does not yet exist.\n\nIf we first run database migrations **and then** update application code (ECS services), then we can avoid errors about fields not existing. In our production application, we want to aim for fewer errors, so we should be using this \"order of operations\": first run new database migrations and then update application code.\n\n### GitHub Action for application updates\n\nWe need a GitHub Action that can do the following:\n\n- fetch the current container definition JSON files for each backend tasks (`aws ecs describe-task-definition`)\n- write new container definitions JSON with the new backend image tag\n- register new task definitions with the new container definition JSON files for each task (`aws ecs register-task-definition`)\n- call run-task with the newly updated migration ECS task (`aws ecs run-task`)\n- wait for the task to exit and display the logs\n- update the backend services (gunicorn, celery, celery beat) (`aws ecs update-service`)\n- wait for the new backend services to be stable (`aws ecs wait services-stable`)\n\nHere's a visual representation of the backend update process:\n\n![png](\u002Fstatic\u002Fadhoc\u002Fad_hoc.backend_update.drawio.png)\n\nIn order have the correct arguments for all of the AWS CLI calls used in the above workflow, we can fetch values from `terraform output` and save values into environment variables, and then use these value in a later stage of our GitHub Actions workflow. Alternatively, we can use the AWS CLI to fetch resource names by tag.\n\nWe should also consider the following:\n\n- the GitHub Action should call a script that runs the steps described above instead of writing the script directly in the GitHub Action itself. This will make debugging easier and will also make it easier to setup automation pipelines using a tool other than GitHub Actions if we choose to do so later\n- how do we structure this script? should it be one big script, or can we break out each step into small scripts? we should try to use KISS and DRY principles\n\n### Frontend updates\n\nThe process described above is needed for updating the backend application. Updating the frontend application involves a similar process to the backend update:\n\n- fetch the container definition JSON for the frontend tasks (`aws ecs describe-task-definition`)\n- write new container definition JSON with the new frontend image tag\n- register new task definitions with the new container definition JSON file for the frontend task (`aws ecs register-task-definition`)\n- update the frontend service (`aws ecs update-service`)\n- wait for the new backend services to be stable (`aws ecs wait services-stable`)\n\n## How to destroy an ad hoc environment\n\nDestroying an ad hoc environment is as simple as creating or updating an ad hoc environment. We simply provide the name of the terraform workspace and corresponding `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` file and another GitHub Action will run `terraform destroy` with the correct inputs.\n\nThe `\u003Cname\u003E.tfvars` will not be automatically deleted.\n\nNo data from the ad hoc environment will be deleted. The S3 bucket objects will be destroyed, as well as the database for the specific ad hoc environment.\n\n## Keeping track of ad hoc environments\n\nWe need to think about how we can keep track of our active ad hoc environments. Active environments will incur additional AWS costs, and we do not want developers or the product team to create lots of environments and then leave them running without actively using them.\n\nWe may decide to have some long-lived ad hoc environments, but those would be managed primarily by the DevOps team and respective owners (e.g. QA, product team, etc.).\n\nOne way to check the active ad hoc environments would be to use the AWS CLI. We could list the ECS clusters in our development account, and this would show the number of ad hoc environments running. We could go farther and list the ad hoc environments by when they were last updated. We could then request developers or team members to remove ad hoc environments that are not in use.\n\nOr we could have a policy that all ad-hoc environments are deleted automatically at the end of the week.\n\nThere could be a lot of ways to track active ad hoc environments, so I won't go into more alternatives here.\n\n## Other considerations\n\n- [ ] Creating new databases without using SSH or bastion host\n\n## AWS Usage Quotas\n\n- [ ] Make sure that there are no default usage quotas that would be exceeded for some number of concurrent ad hoc environments.\n\n## Options for ad hoc environment settings\n\nAt the very minimum, our ad hoc environments need to know what versions of the frontend and backend application to use (the image tag for the frontend and backend images that have been pushed to ECR).\n\n- [ ] Public or private - do you want anyone on the internet to be able to access your ad hoc environment, or should the environment only be accessible over a private VPN connection. A `public` boolean could default to `false`, and you could have the environment only available\n\n- [ ] Custom environment variables\n\n## Deploying the application from your local machine\n\nDeploying the application from your local machine can have a faster feedback loop while developing. This allows us to iterate on the deployment pipeline before automating it in GitHub Actions or another automation platform.\n\nIn order to deploy the application, you will need to do the following:\n\n- set up resources for an S3 backend that can be used by both the shared infrastructure and the ad hoc environments\n  - this can be done with the `tf-bootstrap-*` Makefile targets in the `django-step-by-step` repo\n  - take note of the S3 bucket name and dynamodb table name\n  - store these in a file called `backend.config` that will be used in both the shared infrastructure deployment and the ad hoc environment deployment\n- Install the AWS CLI and configure credentials with sufficient permissions (admin)\n- build and push the frontend and backend application images to the ECR repositories that were set up with the `tf-bootstrap-*` commands\n- Deploy base layer application\n  - in the `terraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments` repo, deploy the `examples\u002Fsimple` terraform configuration. This requires two inputs:\n    1. the `certificate_arn` for the wildcard certificate that will be used on the shared load balancer\n    2. the AWS Key Pair name that will be used for SSHing into the bastion host\n  - The bucket name, region and key will be used\n\n## Spin everything up\n\nStarting with an empty AWS account, here is how to get ad hoc environments set up.\n\n### S3 backend resources and ECR repositories\n\nWe first want to set up an S3 backend that we can use for storing our Terraform state files as well as ECR repositories for storing the images used for the frontend and backend components of our application. There are a few ways to do this:\n\n1. Set things up manually (not recommended)\n2. Set things up using Terraform (this is what I'm doing currently)\n3. Set things up using a CloudFormation template\n4. Use Terraform Cloud\n\nI'll be using option 2. This is sometimes referred to as \"bootstrapping\". When using CDK for IaC, you will do something similar that sets up S3 buckets and ECR repositories used to manage the assets used for application deployment.\n\nHave a look at [this README.md file](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fdjango-step-by-step\u002Fblob\u002Fmain\u002Fterraform\u002Fbootstrap\u002FREADME.md) for more information about bootstrapping a Terraform S3 backend.\n\nWe can use the `make tf-bootstrap` command from the `django-step-by-step` GitHub repo to do this. Before running `make tf-bootstrap`, we need to copy the `bootstrap.tfvars.template` file to `bootstrap.tfvars` and add values for `region` and `backend_name`. Setting up these resources takes just a few seconds.\n\n### Set up shared infrastructure\n\nThe next step is to setup shared infrastructure components that our ad hoc environments will use. We will use the S3 backend that was setup in the previous step to store the Terraform state for our shared resources. The shared resources is configured with a dedicated Terraform module that I have published to the Terraform Registry ([link](https:\u002F\u002Fregistry.terraform.io\u002Fmodules\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fad-hoc-environments\u002Faws\u002Flatest)). The git repo for this Terraform module contains a simple example (located in [`examples\u002Fsimple`](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fterraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments\u002Ftree\u002Fmain\u002Fexamples\u002Fsimple)) that I use to set up the shared resources.\n\nWe will need to provide a `backend.config` file that will be used to configure the S3 backend where we will store the terraform state for the shared resources.\n\nThis terraform configuration will not be updated frequently, so there is no GitHub Actions pipeline that will be used for updating and deploying the shared resources. For larger infrastructure teams, it might make sense to build a GitHub Actions pipeline for introducing changes to the shared resources rather than deploying from a local machine.\n\nThe shared resources terraform configuration requires two inputs:\n\n- `certificate_arn`: the ARN of a pre-provisioned wildcard ACM certificate that will be used to provide secure connections to the shared load balancer over the public internet. (My approach to ad hoc environments assumes that the environments can be accessed over the public internet without a VPN connection, but your requirements may be different)\n- `key_name`: the name of a pre-existing EC2 key pair name that will be used to access the bastion host from GitHub Actions. We need this in order to create databases in our RDS instance per ad hoc environment\n\n### Setting up an ad hoc environment\n\nNow that we have set up shared resources, we can start\n\n## Spin everything down\n\nTo get rid of all of the AWS resources used to support ad hoc environments, we need to delete the following:\n\n- all ad hoc environments\n- shared resources\n- S3 bucket and dynamodb table that were used to store terraform state\n\n### Delete ad hoc environment\n\nThis can be done by running the `terraform destroy` GitHub Actions job with the name of the ad hoc environment to be destroyed.\n\n### Delete shared resources\n\nCurrently this can be done from the command line using the `make examples-simple-destroy` Makefile command in the `terraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments` repo.\n\n### Delete the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table that are used to store and lock state files\n\nThis can be done from the `django-step-by-step` repo using the `make tf-bootstrap-destroy` command.\n\n\n## State management & resource lifecycle\n\nLet's take a look at the way that state is stored and shared between different components of our ad hoc environment setup.\n\n## Diagram\n\nHere's a diagram that shows both where state is stored as well as the lifecycle of resources used in ad hoc environments.\n\n![png](\u002Fstatic\u002Fadhoc\u002Flifecycle.drawio.png)\n\n## High level overview of lifecycle (A - F)\n\n### `A`: bootstrapped S3 backend for terraform state\n\nThese resource are long lived and they provide the ability to store Terraform state (a JSON object that described what is deployed to our AWS account) as well as Elastic Container Registry repos that store builds of our frontend and backend application.\n\n### `B`: deploy shared resources for ad hoc environments\n\nAd hoc environments share resources. This helps keeps startup speeds low and also helps to keep costs down.\n\n### `C`: launch (or update) ad hoc environments\n\nAd hoc environments can be launched by developers for testing a feature, or setting up an environment for a product demo. The same process used for launching a new environment can be used for updating an existing environment. Application versions can be updated through updating Terraform, or through a GitHub Action that makes a series of AWS CLI calls to make rolling updates to ECS services. This is triggered by a manual GitHub Action.\n\n### `D`: destroy an ad hoc environment\n\nOnce an ad hoc environment is no longer needed, it can be destroyed by running another GitHub Action with the name of the ad hoc environment to destroy as the only input.\n\n### `E`: destroy shared resources\n\nIf ad hoc environments are no longer needed altogether, then the shared resources can be deleted as they incur costs.\n\n### `F`: destroy bootstrap resources\n\nOnce all ad hoc environments and shared resources are removed, the S3 backend resource can also be removed.\n\n## Ad hoc infrastructure component and process details (1 - 25)\n\n### `1`: `make tf-bootstrap`\n\nThis command does a `terraform init \u002F plan \u002F apply` to create the S3 backend resources needed for storing state files for both shared infrastructure and per-environment resources (using Terraform workspaces).\n\n### `1`: S3 backend Terraform configuration\n\n[Link](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fdjango-step-by-step\u002Ftree\u002Fmain\u002Fterraform\u002Fbootstrap) to this Terraform configuration.\n\n### `1`: S3 bucket for S3 backend\n\nThe S3 bucket that is used to store Terraform state files. The bucket name is provided in `bootstrap.tfvars`.\n\n### `1`: DynamoDB lock table\n\nMore information about state locking can be found [here](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.terraform.io\u002Flanguage\u002Fsettings\u002Fbackends\u002Fs3#dynamodb-table-permissions).\n\n### `1`: ECR resources\n\nThe bootstrap terraform configuration includes Elastic Container Registry repos used for storing frontend and backend application container images that will be used in the ECS clusters for each ad hoc environment.\n\n### `1`: S3 backend outputs\n\nThe S3 backend Terraform configuration has Terraform outputs that can be used\n\n### `1`: Terraform state file for S3 backend\n\nThe state file that stores the state for our AWS resources that store state for our ad hoc environments is stored on my local machine. This is not ideal, but the S3 backend resource are fairly simple and will not be changed as we use and develop our ad hoc environment infrastructure setup. Also, these resources can easily be delete manually from the AWS console.\n\n### `1`: `make examples-simple` for setting up shared resources\n\n`make examples-simple` is a Makefile command from the `briancaffey\u002Fterraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments` repo. Like `tf-bootstrap`, it also wraps `terraform init \u002F plan \u002F apply` commands, but for another Terraform configuration.\n\n### `1`: `terraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments` Terraform module on Terraform Registry\n\nThe `terraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments` module has been published to the Terraform Registry and can be viewed [here](https:\u002F\u002Fregistry.terraform.io\u002Fmodules\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fad-hoc-environments\u002Faws\u002Flatest).\n\n### `1`: VPC module\n\n### `1`: AWS Cloud Map\n\n### `1`: EC2 instance (bastion host)\n\n### `1`: RDS instance\n\n### `1`: Application Load Balancer\n\n### `1`: IAM resources\n\n### `1`: ECS roles\n\n### `1`: Shared resources state file\n\n### `1`: `workflow_dispatch`\n\n### `1`: `create_update_ad_hoc_env` GitHub Action\n\n### `1`: Ad hoc environment name\n\n### `1`: `terraform-aws-django` Terraform module\n\n[Link](https:\u002F\u002Fregistry.terraform.io\u002Fmodules\u002Fbriancaffey\u002Fdjango\u002Faws\u002Flatest) to the `terraform-aws-django` module on the Terraform Registry.\n\n### `1`: ECS cluster\n\nOne ECS cluster is created for each ad hoc environment. The ECS cluster resources is is a grouping of ECS services and tasks.\n\n### `1`: ECS services\n\nThe application uses the following ECS services for ad hoc environments:\n\n- `gunicorn` - web server process for the API\n- `celery` - web worker that processes tasks\n- `celery beat` - job scheduler that creates tasks for celery workers to process\n- `nginx` - for serving the frontend application\n- `redis` - a stateful service that is used for application data caching and brokering tasks\n\n### `1`: S3 bucket for ad hoc environment\n\nEach ad hoc environment will have a dedicated S3 bucket for storing static and media files. In the context of the example application we are running, these files are all image files\n\n### `1`: ALB Listener Rules\n\nThere is a single load balancer shared across all ad hoc environments. Each ad hoc environments has associated listener rules that route requests based on the path to the correct application\n\n### `1`: Postgres database in RDS instance\n\nEach ad hoc environment uses a dedicated postgres database that lives in an RDS instance that is shared by all ad hoc environments.\n\n### `1`: Redis\n\nRedis is a key-value database that is used for application data caching and brokering tasks. Running redis servers as an ECS service is an alternative to using a managed ElastiCache instance per environment.\n\n### `1`: Service Discovery Service (CloudMap)\n\nIn order for our backend application containers to communicate with the Redis ECS service, we need to set up a Service Discovery service for Redis. This will maintain an internal Route 53 record that points to the private IP of the Redis ECS service.\n\n### `1`: `terraform-remote-state`\n\n[`terraform-remote-state`](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.terraform.io\u002Flanguage\u002Fstate\u002Fremote-state-data) is used to share state between two Terraform configurations. For example, the endpoint of the RDS instance needs to shared from the shared resources Terraform Configuration to the ad hoc environment configuration.\n\n### `1`: `destroy_ad_hoc_env`\n\n### `1`: `make examples-simple-destroy`\n\n### `1`: `make tf-bootstrap-destroy`\n\n### `1`: `briancaffey\u002Fdjango-step-by-step` GitHub repo\n\n### `1`: `briancaffey\u002Fterraform-aws-django` GitHub repo\n\n### `1`: `briancaffey\u002Fterraform-aws-ad-hoc-environments` GitHub repo\n\n### Google Drive link to this draw.io diagram\n\n[Google Drive link to this diagram](https:\u002F\u002Fdrive.google.com\u002Ffile\u002Fd\u002F1Te427LEPSlGinEfncH39gArHxwB1cMp0\u002Fview?usp=sharing).
