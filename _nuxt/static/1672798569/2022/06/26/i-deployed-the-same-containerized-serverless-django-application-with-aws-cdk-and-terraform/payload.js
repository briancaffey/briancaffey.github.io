This article discusses my experience with these two popular Infrastructure as Code tools. I will show my process for developing and using reusable code modules for provisioning infrastructure on AWS to support a sample micro blogging application built with Django.\n\n# My Infrastructure as Code Rosetta Stone: Deploying the same app on AWS ECS with CDK, Terraform a nd Pulumi\n\n## Why I made this project\n\n1. To learn more about AWS, IaC, CI\u002FCD, Automation and Platform Engineering\n\n- learn differences between major IaC tools and how to use them\n\n2. To fail as many times as possible\n\n- Every time I fail when I think I have things right, I learn something new\n- Failed IaC pipelines can sometimes be scary, and every failure I have on these project can teach me about potential failure modes for live projects running in production\n\n3. To take an application-first approach to DevOps\n\n- While learning about IaC, I had a hard time finding in-depth materials covering application development, CI\u002FCD pipelines and automation and Infrastructure as Code and how these three knowledge domains work together\n- this is the main reason why the libraries have `django` in the name\n- You could probably use another framework with these IaC libraries like Flask or Rails, and there isn't really anything that is Django-specific in these libraries\n- I'm more experienced with Django than I am in any other web framework\n\n4. To develop a project I can reference when helping myself and others\n\n- companies and projects that do IaC and CI\u002FCD for the most part have things in private repos\n- for example: how do I split up IaC and application deployments? I see this question asked over. I want to be able to use this project to **show** people how it can be done, not just tell them.\n- I'm trying to do what are you doing, thanks so much for sharing. Mine isn't working, and I can't share it with you, can you help me? No!\n\n5. To encourage others (in the CDK, Terraform and Pulumi communities) to share complete, simple and non-trivial examples of IaC software **in use**.\n\n- There are many ways one could create \"IaC Rosetta Stone\" (public cloud providers x CI\u002FCD providers x IaC tools)\n- Application developers who are increasingly being tasked operations tasks\n\n6. I have nothing to sell you\n\n- So many articles about Cloud are trying to sell you some tool. Outside of what I consider to be mainstream, dominant vendors like GitHub and AWS, there are no products that I'm trying to sell. I'm also not trying to sell anyone on using my IaC packages. Hopefully my IaC packages can serve as helpful reference.\n\n7. Walk before running\n\n- Build up confidence with vanilla without getting too fancy\n- Build a foundation for learning about new things (Pulumi Automation API, Terragrunt for Terraform, self-mutating CDK Pipelines)\n\n8. 12 Factor App and DevOps\n\n- 12 Factor App is great, and has guided how I approach both Django application development and IaC library development\n- It would be better if 12 Factor App had an official companion app in a few major frameworks with the goal of demonstrating *how* to follow the 12Factor App principles with a relatively straightforward example app\n\n## Terminology\n\n### constructs, modules and components\n\n- CDK: constructs and stacks\n- Terraform: modules (and stacks) [https:\u002F\u002Fdiscuss.hashicorp.com\u002Ft\u002Fwhat-is-a-terraform-stack\u002F31985](https:\u002F\u002Fdiscuss.hashicorp.com\u002Ft\u002Fwhat-is-a-terraform-stack\u002F31985)\n- Pulumi: components and stacks\n\nIn this article I will refer to constructs\u002Fmodules\u002Fcomponents as **c\u002Fm\u002Fc** for brevity, and the term stack can generally be used to refer to either a CloudFormation stack, a Pulumi Stack or a Terraform group of resources that are part of a module that has had `apply` ran against it.\n\n### What is a stack?\n\nConstructs and Components are similar, but Constructs map to CloudFormation and Components generally seem to map to Terraform resources and modules\n\nFor the pulumi\u002Faws package, the components generally map directly onto Terraform modules.\n\nTransformations are unique to Pulumi\nhttps:\u002F\u002Fwww.pulumi.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fintro\u002Fvs\u002Fterraform\u002F\n\n## Infrastructure as Code library repos\n\nLet's look at the three repos that I wrote for deploying the same type of 3-tier web application to AWS using ECS Fargate with both CDK, Terraform and Pulumi.\n\n- terraform-aws-django\n- pulumi-aws-django\n- cdk-django\n\n### Language\n\n`cdk-django` and `pulumi-aws-django` are both written in TypeScript. `terraform-aws-django` is written in HCL.\n\n### Versions\n\nHere are the versions of CDK, Terraform and Pulumi and related dependencies that I'm using at the time of writing:\n\n- CDK\n- Terraform\n- Pulumi\n\n### Release management and publishing\n\n`pulumi-aws-django` and `terraform-aws-django` both use `release-please` for automatically generating a changelog file and bumping versions.\n\n`cdk-django` uses `projen` for maintaining the changelog and bumping versions and publishing to npm.\n\n### Makefile and local development\n\nEach repo has a Makefile that includes commands that I frequently use when developing new features or fixing bugs. Each repo has commands for the following:\n\n- synthesizing CDK to CloudFormation \u002F running `terraform plan` and previewing pulumi up for both the base and app stacks\n- creating\u002Fupdating an ad-hoc base environment called `dev`\n- destroying all resources in the ad-hoc base environment called `dev`\n- creating an ad-hoc app environment called `alpha` that uses resources from `dev`\n- destroying an ad-hoc app environment called `alpha` that uses resources from `dev`\n\n### ad-hoc vs prod\n\n- the last article I wrote was about ad hoc environments. Also known as \"on-demand\" environments or \"preview\" environments.\n- the motivation for ad-hoc environments is speed and cost\n- you can completely ignore \"ad-hoc\" environments and use the \"prod\" infrastructure for any number of environments (such as dev, QA, RC, stage and prod)\n- prod can be used for prod and any number of pre-prod environments\n- multiple environments built with \"prod\" infrastructure can be configured with a \"knobs and dials\" (e.g., how big are app and DB instances, how many tasks to run in a service, etc.)\n- the \"prod\" infrastructure should be the same for the \"production\" environment and the \"staging\" environment\n\n### Directory structure\n\nThe directory structures for each repo are all similar with some minor differences.\n\nThere are two types of environments: `ad-hoc` and `production`. Within ad-hoc and production, there are two directories `base` and `app`.\n\nEach repo has a directory called `internal` which contain building blocks used by the modules\u002Fcomponents\u002Fconstructs that are exposed. The contents of the `internal` directories are not intended to be used by anyone who is using the libraries.\n\n```\n# CDK construct library repo structure\n\n# Terraform module library repo structure\n\n# Pulumi component library repo structure\n```\n\nThere is a balance to be found between single stacks vs micro stacks.\nBoth the base and app modules\u002Fcomponents\u002Fconstructs could be split out further. For example, the `base` modules\u002Fcomponents\u002Fconstructs could be split into `networking` and `rds`. The `app` stack could be split into different ECS services so that their infrastructure can be deployed independently.\n\nThe rule of thumbs are:\n\n- single stacks are bad because you don't want to put all your eggs in one basket, however your IaC tool should give you confidence about what is going to change when you try to make a change\n- Lots of small stacks can cause overhead and make things more complex than they need to be\n\n### CLOC\n\n### Examples\n\nEach repo contains examples of how to use the respective (module\u002Fcomponent\u002Fconstruct) libraries. These examples allow me to make changes in my local repo and then deploy stacks from my computer (as opposed to using GitHub Actions)\n\n## Communities\n\n- CDK.dev\n- Pulumi Slack\n- Terraform Discourse Forum\n\n## μblog\n\nμblog is a micro blogging application that I have written using Django and Vue.js.\n\n### Mono-repo structure\n\nIt lives in a GitHub mono repo called `django-step-by-step`. This mono repo contains a few different things:\n\n- backend Django application\n- frontend Vue.js application\n- IaC code that uses c\u002Fm\u002Fc from `cdk-django`, `terraform-aws-django` and `pulumi-aws-django`\n- GitHub Actions workflows for both Infrastructure deployments and application deployments\n\nμblog is the reference application that I deploy to infrastructure created with CDK, Terraform and Pulumi. μblog is meant to represent a generic application uses:\n\n- gunicorn for a backend API\n- Vue.js for a client that consumes the backend API\n- celery for async task processing\n- celery beat for scheduling tasks\n- Postgres for relational data\n- Redis for caching and message brokering (and maybe websocket backend)\n- S3 for object storage\n- Django admin for a simple admin interface\n\nThere is a lot more I could add on μblog. For now I'll just mention that it:\n\n- has a great local development environment (supports both docker-compose and virtual environments)\n- demonstrates how to use Django in different ways. It implements the same application using Function Based View and Class Based Views, and implements both a REST API (both with FBV and CBV) and GraphQL.\n- GitHub Actions for running unit tests\n- k6 for load testing\n- contains a documentation site deployed to GitHub pages (made with VuePress) can be found here: [https:\u002F\u002Fbriancaffey.github.io\u002Fdjango-step-by-step\u002F](https:\u002F\u002Fbriancaffey.github.io\u002Fdjango-step-by-step\u002F)\n\n# Infrastructure Deep Dive\n\nLet's go through each of the `c\u002Fm\u002Fc`s used in the three libraries. I'll cover some of the organizational decisions, dependencies and differences between how things are done between CDK, Terraform and Pulumi.\n\nI'll first talk about the two stacks used in ad hoc environments: `base` and `app`. Then I'll talk about the prod environments which are also composed of `base` and `app` stacks.\n\nKeep in mind that there aren't that many differences between the ad hoc environment base and app stacks and the prod environment app and base stacks. A future optimization could be to use a single base and app stack, but I think there is a tradeoff between readability and DRYness of infrastructure code, **especially with Terraform**. In general I try to use very little conditionals with Terraform code. It is much easier to have dynamic configuration in CDK and Pulumi, and probably also for other tools like CDKTF (that I have not yet tried).\n\n## Splitting up the stacks\n\nWhile it is possible to put all resources in a single stack with both Terraform, CDK and Pulumi, it is not recommended to do so.\n\n- Terraform enables this with outputs and `terraform_remote_state`\n- Pulumi encourages the use of [micro stacks](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pulumi.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fguides\u002Forganizing-projects-stacks\u002F)\n- CDK has an article on how to [create an app with multiple stacks](https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.aws.amazon.com\u002Fcdk\u002Fv2\u002Fguide\u002Fstack_how_to_create_multiple_stacks.html)\n\nThe modules\n\nAlso, on-demand environments really lends itself to stacks that are split up.\n\nhttps:\u002F\u002Fdocs.aws.amazon.com\u002Fcdk\u002Fv2\u002Fguide\u002Fresources.html See the section \"Passing unique identifiers\"\n\n## Ad hoc base overview\n\nHere's an overview of the resources used in an ad hoc base environment\n\n### VPC\n\nThe VPC is the first resource that is create as part of the `base` stack.\n- There official, high-level constructs in each IaC tool for building VPCs and all related networking resources.\n\n- `awsx` has a VPC module\n- `terraform-aws-vpc` module\n- L2 VPC Construct in CDK\n\nThe setting in the Terraform VPC module `one_nat_gateway_per_az = false` doesn't seem to exist on the `awsx.ec2.Vpc` module. This will add to cost savings since it will use 1 NAT Gateway instead of 2.\n\n### Security Groups\n\nPulumi and Terraform can be used in a similar way to define security groups. CDK has a much more concise way of defining ingress and egress rules for security groups.\n\n```\nTODO\n# Pulumi Example\n\n# Terraform example\n\n# CDK example\n```\n\n### Load Balancer Resources\n\nThere's not much to comment on here. In each library I have resource group that defines the following:\n\n- Application Load Balancer\n- A default target group\n- An HTTP listener that redirects to HTTPS\n- An HTTPS listener with a default \"fixed-response\" action\n\nProperties from these resources are used in the \"app\" stack to build listener rules for ECS services that are configured with load balancers, such as the backend and frontend web services.\n\n### RDS Resources\n\nOne decision I made for all three libraries is to put the RDS security group and Subnet Group in the same module as the RDS instance. The SG and DB Subnet group could alternatively be grouped closer to the other network resources.\n\nCurrently the RDS resources are part of the \"base\" stack for each library. A future optimization may be to break the RDS instance out of the \"base\" stack and put it in its own stack. The \"RDS\" stack would be dependent on the \"base\" stack, and then \"app\" stack would then be dependent on both the \"base\" stack and the \"RDS\" stack. More stacks isn't necessarily a bad thing, but for my initial implementation of these libraries I have decided to keep the \"micro stacks\" approach limited to only 2 stacks for an environment.\n\n## Ad hoc app overview\n\n### ECS Cluster\n\n- This is a small component that defines both ECS Cluster and the default capacity providers\n- It defaults to not using `FARGATE_SPOT`; ad hoc environments do use `FARGATE_SPOT` for cost savings\n- This would be a good value to\n\n### Shared environment variables\n\n- Struggled to get this right in pulumi. A lot of Pulumi examples used `JSON.stringify` for containerDefinitions in task definitions. I was able to get help from the Pulumi Slack channel; someone recommended that I use `pulumi.jsonStringify` which was added in a relatively recent version of `pulumi\u002Fpulumi`.\n\n- CDK allows you to declare environment variables for a containerDefinition like `{ FOO: \"bar\" }`\n- Pulumi and Terraform require that values are passed like `{ name: \"FOO\", value: \"bar\"}`\n- You could transform `{ FOO: \"bar\" }` into the name\u002Fvalue format, but I didn't bother to do this\n- extra env vars in Terraform to allow for dynamically passing extra environment variables\n\n### Route53 Record\n\nThis is pretty straightforward in each library. Each ad hoc environment gets a Route 53 record, and listener rules for the web services (Django and Vue.js SPA) match on a combination of the host header and path patterns.\n\nThis part is pretty opinionated in that it assumes you want to host the frontend and backend services on the same URL. For example, requests matching `example.com\u002Fapi\u002F*` are routed to the backend API and all other requests matching `example.com\u002F*` are routed to the frontend service.\n\n### Redis\n\nI go into more depth about why I run a Redis instance in an ECS service in my other article. This is only for the ad hoc environments. Production environments will be configured with ElastiCache for managed Redis.\n\nI decided to not make this service use any persistent storage. It may be a good idea to not use FARGATE_SPOT for this service, since restarts to the redis service could cause issues in ad hoc environments. For example, you may get a lot of celery errors in ad hoc environments if redis is not reachable.\n\n### Web Service\n\nThe web service is what defines the main Django application as well as the frontend website (JavaScript SPA or SSR site). I designed the Web Service resources group to be able to support both traditional Django apps (powered by templates), or for Django apps that service only a limited number of endpoints. This `c\u002Fm\u002Fc` has an input parameter called `pathPatterns` which determines which paths it serves. For example, you Django container may serve traffic for `\u002Fapi\u002F*` and `\u002Fadmin\u002F*` only, or it may want to serve all traffic (`\u002F*`).\n\nThe way I use these components in ad hoc and prod environments is heavily opinionated in that it:\n\n- assumes that the frontend SPA\u002FSSR site should have a lower priority rule than the backend service and should route request paths matching `\u002F*`, while the backend service routes requests for a specific list of path patterns (`\u002Fapi\u002F*`, `\u002Fadmin\u002F*`, `\u002Fgraphql\u002F*`, etc.).\n\nYou may want Django to handle most of your routes and 404 pages, in which case you would want the SPA to only handle requests matching certain paths. This would require some more consideration and careful refactoring.\n\n### Celery\n\n- The reason for having a celery service is to be able to have potentially multiple workers that scale independently\n- I use the same Pulumi component for both works and schedulers\n\nThe terminology for this resource group could be better. Celery is one of many options for running async task workers, so it should probably be called something like `AsyncWorker` across the board rather than using the term `celery`.\n\n### Management Command\n\n- Defines a task that can be used to run commands like `collectstatic` and `migrate`\n- These tasks are ran both after the initial `app` stack deployment and before rolling application upgrades\n\n### Passing data between stacks\n\nPulumi uses stack references, Terraform uses remote state and CDK uses Stack Outputs or Stack References\n\n```\n# CDK example\n\n# Terraform example\n\n# Pulumi example\n```\n\n## Design Principles\n\nTerraform, Pulumi and CDK all do a good job of providing extensive examples covering different languages, cloud resource types and (for Terraform and Pulumi) different cloud providers.\n\nHere are some examples of official examples:\n\n- CDK examples\n- Terraform examples\n- Pulumi examples\n\n## CLI scaffolding\n\nCDK and Pulumi have some good options for how to scaffold a project.\n\n- Pulumi has `pulumi new aws-typescript` among lots of other options (run `pulumi new -l` to see over 200 project types)\n- CDK has `projen` CLI commands which can help set up either library code or project code\n- The major benefits of these tools is setting up `tsconfig.json` and `package.json` correctly\n- Terraform is so simple that it doesn't really need tooling for this\n\nAcross the three project I have created lots of package.json files. Each\n\nFor `terraform-aws-django`, I tried to follow the recommendations from [terraform-best-practices.com](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.terraform-best-practices.com\u002F) which helped me a lot with things like consistent naming patterns and directory structures. Two recommendations I followed carefully:\n\n- use the name `this` for resources in a module where that resource is the only resource of its type\n- avoid using nested modules\n\nI think CDK and Pulumi lend themselves to more nesting and abstractions because they can be written in more familiar programming languages with better abstractions, function, loops, classes, etc., so there are some differences in directory structure of my libraries when comparing Terraform to both CDK and Pulumi.\n\n## Environment configuration\n\n- Pulumi defines environment-specific config in files called `Pulumi.{env}.yaml`\n- Terraform uses `{env}.tfvars` for this type of configuration\n- CDK has several options for this type of configuration (`cdk.context.json`, extending stack props, etc.)\n\nI have tried to use sensible defaults for the ad hoc environments. For `prod` environments, it might make more sense to use more config values here. This could help with things like:\n\n- using different instances sizes in QA vs staging vs production environments\n- environment specific config values (application env vars)\n\n## Local development\n\nUsing the Makefile targets in each library repo, my process for developing c\u002Fm\u002Fc involves making code changes followed by Makefile targets that preview\u002Fplan\u002Fdiff against my AWS account, then running deploy\u002Fapply\u002Fup and waiting for things to finish deploying. Once I can validate that things are looking correct in my account, I run the destroy command and make sure that all of the resources are removed successfully. RDS instances can take up to 10 minutes to create, which means that the base stack takes some time to test. The app environment is able to be spun up quickly, but it can sometimes get stuck and take some time to delete services.\n\nHere are some sample times for deploying ad hoc stacks with CDK, Terraform and Pulumi.\n\n```\n# CDK sample time\n\n# Terraform sample time\n\n# Pulumi sample time\n```\n\nHere are some examples of what the diff\u002Fplan\u002Fpreview commands show:\n\n```\n# CDK synth\n\n# Terraform plan\n\n# Pulumi preview\n```\n\n## GitHub Actions\n\n- pulumi action\n- terraform commands (wrapper)\n- CDK commands\n\n## What I did not put in IaC\n\n- ECR\n- ACM\n\n## Tagging\n\n- Terraform and CDK both make it easy to automatically tag all resources in a stack\n- It is possible to do this in Pulumi, but you need to write a little bit of code.\n- https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pulumi.com\u002Fblog\u002Fautomatically-enforcing-aws-resource-tagging-policies\u002F\n- https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjoeduffy\u002Faws-tags-example\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fautotag-ts\n- Tagging is important since I look up resources by tag in GitHub Actions pipelines (for example, the Bastion Host is looked up by tag)\n\n## Next steps\n\nHere are some of the next things I'll be working on in these project, in order of importance:\n\n- Introduce manual approvals in GitHub Actions and allow for the previewing or \"planning\" before proceeding with an live operations in infrastructure pipelines\n- For Pulumi and Terraform, use a Secrets Manager secret for the database instead of hardcoding it. Use the `random` functions to do this\n- Refactor GitHub Actions and make them reusable across different projects\n- Writing tests for Pulumi and CDK. Figure out how to write tests for Terraform modules\n- Use graviton instances and have the option to select between different architectures\n- Standardize all resources names\n- The Pulumi components that define the resources associated with each ECS service are not very dry\n- Interfaces could be constructed with inheritance (base set of properties that is extended for different types of services)\n- Make all three of the libraries less opinionated about how the application as a whole. Celery worker and scheduler should be optional, the frontend component should also be optional\n- experiment with using a frontend with SSR. This is supported by Quasar, the framework I'm currently using to build my frontend SPA site.\n\n## Sharing\n\n- my personal blog (briancaffey.github.io)\n- DEV.to\n- Ops Community\n- Medium\n- Substack\n- My MailChimp mailing list\n- Hacker News\n- Twitter\n- LinkedIn\n- Facebook\n- HashNode\n- Hackernoon\n- Reddit (r\u002Faws, r\u002FTerraform, r\u002Fpulumi, r\u002Fdjango, r\u002Fdevops)\n- Terraform Forum\n- Pulumi Slack channel\n- CDK.dev Slack channel\n"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("text","element","\n","li","code","p","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link","ul",3,"h3",2,"h2"," and ","nofollow","noopener","noreferrer","_blank","ol","terraform-aws-django","base","app","div","nuxt-content-highlight","pre","language-text","line-numbers","μblog","strong",".","pulumi-aws-django","cdk-django","dev","github-actions","celery","c\u002Fm\u002Fc",", ","django",true,"tldr","tl;dr","why-i-made-this-project","Why I made this project","terminology","Terminology","constructs-modules-and-components","constructs, modules and components","what-is-a-stack","What is a stack?","infrastructure-as-code-library-repos","Infrastructure as Code library repos","language","Language","versions","Versions","release-management-and-publishing","Release management and publishing","makefile-and-local-development","Makefile and local development","ad-hoc-vs-prod","ad-hoc vs prod","directory-structure","Directory structure","cloc","CLOC","examples","Examples","communities","Communities","mono-repo-structure","Mono-repo structure","splitting-up-the-stacks","Splitting up the stacks","ad-hoc-base-overview","Ad hoc base overview","vpc","VPC","security-groups","Security Groups","load-balancer-resources","Load Balancer Resources","rds-resources","RDS Resources","ad-hoc-app-overview","Ad hoc app overview","ecs-cluster","ECS Cluster","shared-environment-variables","Shared environment variables","route53-record","Route53 Record","redis","Redis","web-service","Web Service","Celery","management-command","Management Command","passing-data-between-stacks","Passing data between stacks","design-principles","Design Principles","cli-scaffolding","CLI scaffolding","environment-configuration","Environment configuration","local-development","Local development","GitHub Actions","what-i-did-not-put-in-iac","What I did not put in IaC","tagging","Tagging","next-steps","Next steps","sharing","Sharing","h1","https:\u002F\u002Fdiscuss.hashicorp.com\u002Ft\u002Fwhat-is-a-terraform-stack\u002F31985","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pulumi.com\u002Fdocs\u002Fintro\u002Fvs\u002Fterraform\u002F","projen","alpha"," that uses resources from ","internal","https:\u002F\u002Fbriancaffey.github.io\u002Fdjango-step-by-step\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Fdocs.aws.amazon.com\u002Fcdk\u002Fv2\u002Fguide\u002Fresources.html","FARGATE_SPOT","{ FOO: \"bar\" }","\u002Fapi\u002F*","\u002Fadmin\u002F*","\u002F*","https:\u002F\u002Fwww.pulumi.com\u002Fblog\u002Fautomatically-enforcing-aws-resource-tagging-policies\u002F","https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjoeduffy\u002Faws-tags-example\u002Ftree\u002Fmaster\u002Fautotag-ts","2023-01-04T02:14:57.396Z")));
