This made Qin Banger so angry that his old illness relapsed, and within three to five days, he passed away. Qin Zhong had always been weak and hadn't fully recovered from a previous illness.

The roadmap for TensorRT-LLM looks promising, I’m looking forward to support for an OpenAI Compatible API and more models. NVIDIA NIMs using TensorRT-LLM are an easy way to run models as OpenAI compatible API servers, but the selection of models is still pretty limited. vLLM provides a strong alternative with a wide range of support models. NVIDIA NIMs for LLMs build on vLLM libraries and the TensorRT-LLM library, so it is helpful to have an understanding of both of these libraries to stay on the bleeding edge of performant inference engines.",{"type":34,"tag":43,"props":4921,"children":4922},{},[4923],{"type":34,"tag":105,"props":4924,"children":4927},{"alt":4925,"src":4926},"trt-llm-roadmap","/static/redlm/trt-llm-roadmap.png",[],{"type":34,"tag":43,"props":4929,"children":4930},{},[4931],{"type":40,"value":4932},"The NVIDIA API catalog is a great way to test a variety of different models, especially large models that cannot fit into consumer hardware like RTX PCs or high-end MacBooks.

In 2007, living and studying Chinese in Shanghai as a 19 year old American was a really fun time. I was placed in an advanced-level course with a diverse group of students where English was not the lowest common linguistic denominator. We had a demanding cirriculum that emphasized reading, listening and speaking Chinese, but most of the language learning came through extracirricular activities: exploring Shanghai's food scene, bartering with vendors at the fabric markets, late night clubbing, walking around the Bund and the French Concession and chatting with my taxi cab drivers.
