The roadmap for TensorRT-LLM looks promising, I’m looking forward to support for an OpenAI Compatible API and more models. NVIDIA NIMs using TensorRT-LLM are an easy way to run models as OpenAI compatible API servers, but the selection of models is still pretty limited. vLLM provides a strong alternative with a wide range of support models. NVIDIA NIMs for LLMs build on vLLM libraries and the TensorRT-LLM library, so it is helpful to have an understanding of both of these libraries to stay on the bleeding edge of performant inference engines.",{"type":27,"tag":36,"props":4851,"children":4852},{},[4853],{"type":27,"tag":84,"props":4854,"children":4857},{"alt":4855,"src":4856},"trt-llm-roadmap","/static/redlm/trt-llm-roadmap.png",[],{"type":27,"tag":36,"props":4859,"children":4860},{},[4861],{"type":33,"value":4862},"The NVIDIA API catalog is a great way to test a variety of different models, especially large models that cannot fit into consumer hardware like RTX PCs or high-end MacBooks.
