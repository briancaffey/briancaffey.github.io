GPUs are needed to render graphics of enormous open-world environments. Some story-driven games include huge amounts of dialogue that can be considered as huge literary works in their own right. Red Dead Redemption and Genshin Impact are two massively popular games of this type. There might be an interesting project idea that could use LLMs and RAG (retrieval augmented generation), but I don't play these types of games and it didn't seem practical for a project that would be built in just over a month.
