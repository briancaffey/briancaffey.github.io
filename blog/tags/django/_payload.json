The main idea is this: web requests are made to API Gateway that calls a Lambda outside of our VPC (proxy Lambda), which then invokes a second lambda (Django Lambda) inside of our VPC so that it can access VPC resources, namely RDS. The handler for the Django Lambda translates the API Gateway event into a WSGI-compatible request, processes the request and returns the response to the user back through the proxy Lambda. The big caveat is that you can't easily access the internet in Django's request/response cycle without network address translation (NAT) services which add additional costs. One other caveat is that there is high latency associated with the initial request.
