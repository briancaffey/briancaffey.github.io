A recent attempt involved building a 30,000-person analog computer that was destroyed in tri-solar syzygy. Failing to accurately predict the movement of the suns could mean execution by live-burial, a fiery death or worse. Using CUDA and Blender is a good MVP but doesn't make for the best technical demo since it involves so many different steps: running the simulation in CUDA, exporting data to JSON, loading data into a visualuzation and then finally rendering a video of the simulation.
