Development environment refers to the tools and processes by which a developer can make a change to source code and see these changes reflected in some version of the application running on a local environment. The local environment (the developer's computer) should be a close proxy for the production environment where the code will ultimately deployed to for end users. For this project the local development environment is our PC itself, which simplifies things. A development environment should support hot-reloading so incremental changes can be run to test functionality, offering a tight feedback loop. I really like the development environment for this project.
