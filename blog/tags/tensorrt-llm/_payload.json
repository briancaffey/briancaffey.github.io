I closely follow the development of the three leading applications for generating images with stable dissuion models: Stable Diffusion WebUI, InvokeAI and ComfyUI. Write a prompt, instantly see the result, tweak the prompt and generate again. This is the basic process by which I have previously used stable diffusion. It is a satisfying mental exercise that feeds the creative and imaginative part of my brain. My idea for this project came from wanting to automate this process: use large language models to build cohesive scenes and detailed prompts and then feed them into my stable diffusion programs via API. Using LangChain and LangGraph allowed me to rapidly prototype the idea and start generating short feature films in the style of my favorite British Secret Agent: 007.",{"type":37,"tag":38,"props":535,"children":537},{"id":536},"putting-together-the-puzzle-pieces",[538],{"type":43,"value":539},"Putting together the puzzle pieces",{"type":37,"tag":46,"props":541,"children":542},{},[543],{"type":43,"value":544},"Here's how I set up an MVP for my project project to get started.
