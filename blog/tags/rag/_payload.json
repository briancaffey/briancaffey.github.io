This allowed the Q&A bot to answer questions in either Chinese or English, and it does not require translating back and forth between Chinese and English. However, this method relies on high-quality translations, so I don't expect English language questions to be answered as accurately as Chinese language questions. Here are the Chinese and English prompts that I used for the text-based Q&A bot, as well as some examples of the Q&A bot answering questions in English.
