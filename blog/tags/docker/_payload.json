One of the features that I'm not sure how best to implement is the ability to sort holdings for a filer in a given period on the percent increase from the last period. One way would be to add these as additional fields to the Holding model and then calculate these values as I process the data in celery. If I process the data from recent periods to later periods, I will have to update these values once the previous period has been processed, so it would be an additional check to do. I'll probably post this question here in more detail later.

Also, over the last few years there have been many new versions of the software needed to support the GPU version of Tensorflow as well as the first official release of Tensorflow itself (which is now on version 1.4), such as CUDA and cudnn, and different version of python. This is one more attempt at installing the GPU version of Tensor Flow on my Desktop PC that is currently dual booting with Arch Linux and Windows 10.
